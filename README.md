**Opinion**: I find this article interesting because it describes the several 
limitations of current AI Chat models, bringing attention to the fundamental challenges the software faces in truly incorporating human-like understanding and consciousness. Also, I find it particularly important becuase it serves as a reminder of the significance of maintaining a realistic perspective on AI's capabilities, particularly for those without knowledge of NLP and AI who might have fears of AI becoming uncontrollable.
